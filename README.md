# Audio-Freeze-Frame

## About

What if you could freeze frame audio in a meaningful way? Given that our ears are spectral analyzers, it seems that a 'meaningful' auditory freeze frame would preserve the harmonic content of some audio at a moment in time. Unfortunately, this demands some notion of instantaneous frequency-a concept that is explicitly defined across time. This paradox is probably why such a popular concept for video has not been extended to audio.
